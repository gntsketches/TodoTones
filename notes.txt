    add waitTime to todoText
    test
        wait time with all play modes
        mono & poly envelope sounds
    accept delay time for changing to new tod
    AWESOME faux polyphony with portamento and longer duration time

    TODO REFACTORING
        /gi ... g not needed for tempo, percent, duration, may be problem for some things... but would it break things to just remove it?
        THIS WOULD PROBABLY ALL BE A LOT BETTER WITH BETTER NAMES
            NAMES I DON'T LIKE:
                "todoText" term used for both incoming data and for "buildTodoText"... could confuse
                onTodoChanged seems like it should be something like "triggerTodoRender"
                    because this is an active model - it's "calling for" the render.
                    yes, it is also responding to the changing of the todoList,
                    but something about it is confusing
                it could be because I model the same circuitry with "onAudioChanged",
                    which is... different
                anyway - there definitely should be something in common about the naming
                    between M,V,C which tells you which is referring to which
                    but also maybe it should point more clearly "in the direction" of the data flow, or something?
        refactor non-dynamic View.js into some index.html?
        textarea / contenteditable for input? ( so enter can be used for \n...)

    test vim emulator on/off hack - double click to highlight line and press d got it working

% => event percent 01 00
t => tempo bpm
d => duration 2n 4n 8n 16n 23n or in seconds(s)

sequential/random play

{}  > synthtype, (fm/am/fat) sin tri squ saw, all the various mods
    poly/mono
    portamento
    effects of various sorts

huh? - help modal

variable durations, tempos, etc.
"special names" => of presets

*** Advanced *************************************************************************************

phrasing packages - some sort of class/object system to categorize different types of musical events
    plan for it to be able to test seconds or measures
undo/redo... gotta be functional, I think...

LETS WAIT to do save/load stuff until features have been basically decided
import / export preset "names"
    looks for localstorage item with that info on loadup?
import / export compositions



*** MISC ***************************************************************************

how/could this work without the connector?

// this will just use 'constructor' values
    // note how parseHiRange and buildTodoText both accept params that they could also get from constructor
    //  ...what's it called when you have to decide about that?

// meta: Audio as part of the UI, but in this case, the user is "time"
//  so "time" triggers the connector

audio "reads" model directly (but never changes it).
    is there some reason why this might be a bad idea to read it?
