    sequential / random play!
        [Stay/Once/Loop/Random]
        add length option
        Model
            setPlayMode
        View
            notice this is bound separately from displayTodos, but is still a re-render
            so it could be refactored into that as a general re-render of anything re-render-able
        THIS WOULD PROBABLY ALL BE A LOT BETTER WITH BETTER NAMES
            NAMES I DON'T LIKE:
                onTodoChanged seems like it should be something like "triggerTodoRender"
                    because this is an active model - it's "calling for" the render.
                    yes, it is also responding to the changing of the todoList,
                    but something about it is confusing
                it could be because I model the same circuitry with "onAudioChanged",
                    which is... different

    refactor non-dynamic View.js into some index.html
        maybe. full re-render is nice too...

    test vim emulator on/off hack - double click to highlight line and press d got it working
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19038070/html-newline-char-in-div-content-editable
    /gi ... g not needed for tempo, percent, duration... but would it break things to just remove it?
    textarea / contenteditable for input? ( so enter can be used for \n...)
    portamento
    parse envelope
    parse synthjk
    css
        change button color when playing
    huh?
        mention tab vs. enter

*** "basic" features ***********************************************************************

( ... note names ...)
    const p = todoText.match(/\((.*?)\)/i)[0]      //https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2403122/regular-expression-to-extract-text-between-square-brackets
    csv?, excluding #/b duplicates?, 1st char cap, in paren
% => event percent 01 00
t => tempo bpm
d => duration 2n 4n 8n 16n 23n or in seconds(s)

*** Intermediate ******************************************************************************

sequential/random play

[adsr]

{} => synthtype, (fm/am/fat) sin tri squ saw, all the various mods
    poly/mono
    portamento
    effects of various sorts

huh? - help modal

variable durations, tempos, etc.
"special names" => of presets

*** Advanced *************************************************************************************

phrasing packages - some sort of class/object system to categorize different types of musical events

undo/redo... gotta be functional, I think...

LETS WAIT to do save/load stuff until features have been basically decided
import / export preset "names"
    looks for localstorage item with that info on loadup?
import / export compositions




const enharmonicChecker = {
    ''
}


*** MISC ***************************************************************************

// this will just use 'constructor' values
    // note how parseHiRange and buildTodoText both accept params that they could also get from constructor
    //  ...what's it called when you have to decide about that?
